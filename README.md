### Features

- [x] You can send messages both in private and group/supergroup chats
- [x] Channels support (only public, but you can do it for private as well with dirty hack)
- [x] Saves chatid as a temporary file
- [x] Simple markdown and HTML are supported
- [x] Emoji (you can use emoji instead of severity, see [the wiki article](https://github.com/ableev/Zabbix-in-Telegram/wiki/Trigger-severity-as-Emoji)) (zabbix doesn't support utf8mb4 encoding yet)
- [x] Location map

### TODOs
- Simple zabbix's management via bot's commands â€“ in dev state
- Ability to send complex graph or part of screen


### Configuration / Installation

**READ WIKI IF YOU HAVE PROBLEM WITH SOMETHING**: https://github.com/ableev/Zabbix-in-Telegram/wiki

**First of all**: You need to install the appropriate modules for python, this is required for operation! </br>
                  To do so, enter `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your commandline!

**How to install pip**: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

**Or by your system package manager**: 
* *Ubuntu/Debian* - `sudo apt-get install python-pip`(python3-pip for Python3)
* *Centos* - `sudo yum install python-pip` (python3-pip for Python3)

 * Put `zbxtg.py` in your `AlertScriptsPath` directory, the path is set inside your `zabbix_server.conf`
 * Put `zbxtg_group.py` in the same location if you want to send messages to the group chat (if you are using Zabbix 2.x version)
 * Create `zbxtg_settings.py` (copy it from `zbxtg_settings.example.py`) with your settings and save them in the same directory as the script, see example for layout
  * Create a bot in Telegram and get API key: https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-new-bot
  * Create readonly user in Zabbix web interface (for getting graphs from zabbix)
  * Set proxy host:port in `zbxtg_settings.py` if you need an internet proxy (socks5 supported as well, the wiki will help you)
 * Add new media for Telegram in Zabbix web interface with these settings:

 * Add another one if you want to send messages to the group

 * **Note that Zabbix 3.0 has different settings for that step, see it there**: https://github.com/ableev/Zabbix-in-Telegram/wiki/Working-with-Zabbix-3.0
 * Send a message to your bot via Telegram, e.g. "/start"
  * If you are in a group chat, start a conversation with your bot: `/start@ZbxTgDevBot`
 * Create a new action like this:
```
Last value: {ITEM.LASTVALUE1} ({TIME})
zbxtg;graphs
zbxtg;graphs_period=10800
zbxtg;itemid:{ITEM.ID1}
zbxtg;title:{HOST.HOST} - {TRIGGER.NAME}
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZNKtBUX.png" width="400px">

 * Add the appropriate Media Type to your user
  * The username is **CASE-SENSITIVE**
  * If you don't have a username, you can use your chatid directly (and you need to google how to get it)
  * Group chats don't have URLs, so you need to put group's name in media type
  * Messages for channels should be sent as for private chats (simply add bot to your channel first and use channel's username as if it was a real user)

  * Private:

  * Group:

#### Annotations
```
zbxtg;graphs -- enables attached graphs
zbxtg;graphs_period=10800 -- set graphs period (default - 3600 seconds)
zbxtg;graphs_width=700 -- set graphs width (default - 900px)
zbxtg;graphs_height=300 -- set graphs height (default - 300px)
zbxtg;itemid:{ITEM.ID1} -- define itemid (from trigger) for attach
zbxtg;itemid:{ITEM.ID1},{ITEM.ID2},{ITEM.ID3} -- same, but if you want to send two or more graphs, use complex trigger
zbxtg;title:{HOST.HOST} - {TRIGGER.NAME} -- graph's title
zbxtg;debug -- enables debug mode, some logs and images will be saved in the tmp dir (temporary doesn't affect python version)
zbxtg;channel -- enables sending to channels
zbxtg;to:username1,username2,username3 -- now you don't need to create dedicated profiles and add media for them, use this option in action to send messages to those user(s)
zbxtg;to_group:Group Name One,Group Name Two -- the same but for groups
```

You can use markdown or html formatting in your action: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#markdown-style + https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#html-style. 

#### Debug

* You can use the following command to send a message from your command line: </br>
`./zbxtg.py "@username" "first part of a message" "second part of a message" --debug`
 * For `@username` substitute your Telegram username, **NOT that of your bot** (case-sensitive) OR chatid
 * For `first part of a message` and `second part of a message` just substitute something like "test" "test" (for Telegram it's doesn't matter between subject and body)
 * You can skip the `"` if it's one word for every parameter, these are optional
